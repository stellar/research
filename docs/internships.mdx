# Internships

We offer research internships for PhD students (year-round).
Internships usually last 3 to 4 month and are usually remote, with one or two visits in person at our San Francisco or NYC offices.

We are currently looking for a research intern (summer or fall) for a model-based testing project.
If you are interested, please reach out to [giuliano@stellar.org](mailto:giuliano@stellar.org).
